            <font size="5">One of the greatest Indian freedom fighters that history witnessed was none other than Subhas<br>
            Chandra Bose. He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and his <br>
            ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence <br>
            promoted by Gandhi, instead of believing that only armed revolt could oust the British from <br>
            India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the British to ultimately reach <br>
            Germany during the second world war. He raised the Indian National Army (INA) and with <br>
            Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian territory from the British in Manipur, but was <br>
            ultimately defeated due to Japanese surrender to the British. Although he is believed to have<br>
            died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains shrouded in mystery to date.<br><br>

            The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, <br>
            Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, <br>
            and the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his <br>
            parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil <br>
            Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, <br>
            after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and <br>
            hurried back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he <br>
            was supported financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose <br>
            (1889-1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress <br>
            (also known as the Congress Party) politician.<br><br>

            Bose joined the noncooperation movement started by Mohandas K. Gandhi, <br>
            who had made the Indian National Congress a powerful nonviolent organization. <br>
            Bose was advised by Gandhi to work under Chitta Ranjan Das, a politician in Bengal. <br>
            There Bose became a youth educator, journalist, and commandant of the Bengal Congress <br>
            volunteers. His activities led to his imprisonment in December 1921. In 1924 <br>
            he was appointed chief executive officer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, <br>
            with Das as mayor. Bose was soon after deported to Burma (Myanmar) because <br>
            he was suspected of connections with secret revolutionary movements. Released in <br>
            1927, he returned to find Bengal Congress affairs in disarray after the death of Das, <br>
            and Bose was elected president of the Bengal Congress. Shortly thereafter he and <br>
            Jawaharlal Nehru became the two general secretaries of the Indian National Congress. <br>
            Together they represented the more militant, left-wing faction of the party <br>
            against the more compromising, right-wing Gandhian faction.<br><br><br></font>
