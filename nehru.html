            <font size="5">
                Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14th November 1889. He was the single child of Motilal <br>
                Nehru and Swarup Rani Nehru. Nehru was one of the most renowned barristers and was known <br>
                for his intellectual capabilities which soon made him one of the greatest politicians India had <br>
                ever seen. Nehru, under the approval of Gandhi, his mentor, rose to become one of the most <br>
                dominant figures in Indian politics from the 1930s onwards. Nehru, after much deliberations, <br>
                accepted the partition proposal for India in 1947 and took oath as the First Prime Minister of <br>
                India after attaining independence. His birthday on 14 November is widely celebrated in India as <br>
                Children's day.<br><br>

                Nehru was born to a family of Kashmiri Brahmans, noted for their administrative aptitude and <br>
                scholarship, who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century. He was a son of Motilal Nehru, <br>
                a renowned lawyer and leader of the Indian independence movement, who became one of Mohandas <br>
                (Mahatma) Gandhi's prominent associates. Jawaharlal was the eldest of four children, two of <br>
                whom were girls. A sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, later became the first woman president of <br>
                the United Nations General Assembly.<br><br>

                Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses and tutors. <br>
                Only one of those—a part-Irish, part-Belgian theosophist, Ferdinand Brooks—appears to have made <br>
                any impression on him. Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor who taught him Hindi <br>
                and Sanskrit. In 1905 he went to Harrow, a leading English school, where he stayed for two years.<br> 
                Nehru's academic career was in no way outstanding. From Harrow he went to Trinity College, <br>
                Cambridge, where he spent three years earning an honours degree in natural science. <br>
                On leaving Cambridge he qualified as a barrister after two years at the Inner Temple, <br>
                London, where in his own words he passed his examinations “with neither glory nor ignominy.”<br><br>
