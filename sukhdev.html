                Sukhdev, who was born in 1907, was a brave revolutionary and a key member of the Hindustan <br>
                Socialist Republican Association. Without a doubt, he was one of the most revered figures of <br>
                the Indian freedom struggle. He collaborated closely with his colleagues Bhagat Singh and <br>
                Shivram Rajguru. He was accused of being involved in the assassination of British officer John <br>
                Saunders. Unfortunately, at the age of 24, he was caught and hanged with Bhagat Singh and <br>
                Shivaram Rajguru on March 23, 1931, in Punjab's Hussainwala (now in Pakistan). <br><br>

                Sukhdev was born to Ramlal and Ralli Devi Thapar in Ludhiana, Punjab.<br>
                He showed a defiant spirit from an early age itself. During his school days, he would <br>
                refuse to salute the British officers who visited his school.<br><br>

                Having lost his father at an early age, Sukhdev was raised by his uncle. It was the arrest of his <br>
                uncle that led him to revolutionary activities for freedom from colonial rule.<br>
                Sukhdev joined the Naujawan Bharat Seva, which had been started by Bhagat Singh in 1926. <br>
                The two became close friends and associates.<br><br>

                He participated in many activities to promote national consciousness among the country's <br>
                young people in the Punjab area.<br>
                He was also an active member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). <br>
                The HSRA was a radical organisation actively involved in revolutionary activities against the British government.<br>

                Sukhdev, while in college, studied the various revolutions of the world, particularly the Russian Revolution.<br>

                In an anti-Simon Commission rally in 1928, veteran Congress leader Lala Lajpat Rai was cruelly beaten by a lathi <br>
                by a British police officer named James A Scott. Lajpat Rai succumbed to injuries sustained a few days later.<br>
                <br><br>
                The young revolutionaries including Sukhdev decided to avenge Lajpat Rai's death. As per Bhagat Singh's biographer, <br>
                it was Sukhdev who chose Bhagat Singh to assassinate Scott.<br><br>

                However, on 17th December 1928, Bhagat Singh and his accomplices Sukhdev and Rajguru killed an Assistant <br>
                Superintendent of Police, John P. Saunders in a case of mistaken identity.<br><br>

                They still declared that Lajpat Raiâ€™s death had been avenged. After committing the act, the trio escaped.<br>
                They fled from Lahore by rail to Lucknow. Rajguru went on to Benares from Lucknow. He returned to Lahore a few days later.<br>
                The British government managed to capture all the people involved in the assassination. Rajguru was arrested <br>
                while he was in a bomb factory in Lahore in March 1929. All three were sentenced to death by hanging in the trial that ensued.<br>
                While lodged in prison, Rajguru and his friends went on a hunger strike demanding improved conditions for political prisoners.<br><br><br>
