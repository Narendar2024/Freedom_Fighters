                Kunwar Singh was born in April 1777 to the Maharaja and Maharani of Jagdispur (now in <br>
                Bhojpur District, Bihar) to the Maharaja and Maharani of Jagdispur. His name is often lost amid <br>
                the other more renowned names of the Revolt. Nonetheless, his contribution to the First War of <br>
                Independence was enormous. Kunwar Singh led the uprising in Bihar. On July 25, 1857, he <br>
                gained command of the sepoys stationed at Danapur at the age of nearly 80. Kunwar Singh <br>
                took over Azamgarh in March 1858. (now in UP). He then went home and commanded a <br>
                successful fight near Jagdispur on July 23rd. The British, headed by Captain le Grand, were <br>
                beaten in this fight despite Kunwar Singh being the fact that Kunwar Singh was severely hurt. <br><br>

                Kunwar Singh was a leader during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He belonged to a family of <br>
                the Ujjainiya clan of the Parmar Rajputs of Jagdispur, currently a part of Bhojpur district, <br>
                Bihar, India. At the age of 80, he led a selected band of armed soldiers against the troops under <br>
                the command of the British East India Company. He was the chief organiser of the fight against <br>
                the British in Bihar. He is popularly known as Veer Kunwar Singh.<br><br>

                Singh led the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in Bihar. He was nearly eighty and in failing health when he was <br>
                called upon to take up arms. He was assisted by both his brother, Babu Amar Singh and his commander-in-chief, <br>
                Hare Krishna Singh. Some argue that the latter was the real reason behind Kunwar Singh's initial military success. <br>
                He gave a good fight and harried British forces for nearly a year and remained invincible until the end. <br>
                He was an expert in the art of guerilla warfare. His tactics left the British puzzled.<br><br>

                To honour his contribution to India's freedom movement, the Republic of India issued a commemorative stamp <br>
                on 23 April 1966. The Government of Bihar established the Veer Kunwar Singh University, Arrah in 1992.<br><br>

                In 2017, the Veer Kunwar Singh Setu, also known as the Arrah-Chhapra Bridge, was inaugurated to connect <br>
                north and south Bihar. In 2018, to celebrate 160th anniversary of Kunwar Singh's death, the government <br>
                of Bihar relocated a statue of him to Hardinge Park. The park was also officially renamed as <br>
                'Veer Kunwar Singh Azadi Park'.<br><br><br><br>
