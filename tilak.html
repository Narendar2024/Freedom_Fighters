            <font size="5">
                Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a remarkable freedom fighter born in 1856. Famously known for his <br>
                quote, 'Swaraj is my Birthright.  He published several rebellious newspapers and built schools to <br>
                defy British Rule. He was the third member of the Lal-Bal-Pal along with Lala Lajpat Rai and <br>
                Bipin Chandra Pal.<br><br>

                Tilak was born into a cultured middle-class Brahman family. Although his birth place was Bombay (Mumbai), <br>
                he was raised in a village along the Arabian Sea coast in what is now Maharashtra state until the age of 10, <br>
                when his father, an educator and noted grammarian, took a job in Poona (now Pune). The young Tilak was <br>
                educated at Deccan College in Poona, where in 1876,he earned bachelor's degrees in mathematics and Sanskrit. <br>
                Tilak then studied law, receiving his degree in 1879 from the University of Bombay (now Mumbai). <br>
                At that point, however, he decided to teach mathematics in a private school in Poona. The school became <br>
                the basis for his political career. He developed the institution into a university college after founding the <br>
                Deccan Education Society (1884), which aimed at educating the masses, especially in the English language; <br>
                he and his associates considered English to be a powerful force for the dissemination of liberal and democratic ideals.<br><br>

                The life members of the society were expected to follow an ideal of selfless service, but when Tilak learned that <br>
                some members were keeping outside earnings for themselves, he resigned. He then turned to the task of awakening <br>
                the political consciousness of the people through two weekly newspapers that he owned and edited: Kesari (“The Lion”), <br>
                published in Marathi, and The Mahratta, published in English. Through those newspapers Tilak became widely <br>
                known for his bitter criticisms of British rule and of those moderate nationalists who advocated social reforms <br>
                along Western lines and political reforms along constitutional lines. He thought that social reform would only <br>
                divert energy away from the political struggle for independence.<br><br><br>
