                Lal Bahadur Shastri was born on 2nd October 1904 in the state of Uttar Pradesh. He was <br>
                conferred with the title of Shastri which in English is termed as Scholar. At the age of only <br>
                sixteen, he left his studies to join the non-cooperation movement at the call of Gandhi. Later, he <br>
                graduated with a first-class degree from Kashi Vidyapeeth, a national institution of higher <br>
                education inaugurated by Gandhi. He was one of the most proactive Indian freedom fighters <br>
                who participated in various movements such as the Quit India movement, Civil Disobedience <br>
                movement and other satyagrahas led by Mahatma Gandhi. Lal Bahadur Shastri was <br>
                incarcerated by the British for considerable periods during his lifetime. Post attaining <br>
                independence, he first became the Home Minister and later was made the Prime Minister of <br>
                India in the year 1964.<br><br>

                Shastri was born on 2 October 1904 at the home of his maternal grandparents in a Kayastha family. <br>
                Shastri's paternal ancestors had been in the of the zamindar of Ramnagar near Banaras, and Shastri <br>
                lived there for the first year of his life. Shastri's father, Sharada Prasad Srivastava, was a school <br>
                teacher who later became a clerk in the revenue office at Allahabad, while his mother, Ramdulari Devi, <br>
                was the daughter of Munshi Hazari Lal, the headmaster and English teacher at a railway school in Mughalsarai. <br>
                Shastri was the second child and eldest son of his parents; he had an elder sister, Kailashi Devi (b. 1900).<br><br>

                In April 1906, when Shastri was hardly 18 months old, his father, who had only recently been promoted to the <br>
                post of deputy tahsildar, died in an epidemic of bubonic plague. Ramdulari Devi, then only 23 years old and <br>
                pregnant with her third child, took her two children and moved from Ramnagar to her father's house in <br>
                Mughalsarai and settled there for good. She gave birth to a daughter, Sundari Devi, in July 1906. <br>
                Thus, Shastri and his sisters grew up in the household of his maternal grandfather, Hazari Lalji. <br>
                However, Hazari Lalji himself died from a stroke in mid-1908. Thereafter, the family was looked after by <br>
                his brother (Shastri's great-uncle) Darbari Lal, who was the head clerk in the opium regulation department <br>
                    at Ghazipur, and later by his son (Ramdulari Devi's cousin) Bindeshwari Prasad, a school teacher in Mughalsarai.<br><br><br>
