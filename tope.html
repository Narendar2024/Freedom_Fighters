                Tantia Tope was one of the famous revolutionaries of the Rebellion of 1857. Born in 1814, he <br>
                led his soldiers to fight against the dominance of British rule. He made General Windham leave <br>
                Kanpur and helped Rani Lakhsmi Bai reinstating Gwalior.<br><br>

                Indian Mutiny, also called Sepoy Mutiny or First War of Independence, widespread but unsuccessful <br>
                rebellion against British rule in India in 1857-59. Begun in Meerut by Indian troops (sepoys) in the <br>
                service of the British East India Company, it spread to Delhi, Agra, Kanpur, and Lucknow. In India it <br>
                is often called the First War of Independence and other similar names.<br><br>

                To regard the rebellion merely as a sepoy mutiny is to underestimate the root causes leading to it. <br>
                British paramountcy—i.e., the belief in British dominance in Indian political, economic, and cultural <br>
                life—had been introduced in India about 1820. The British increasingly used a variety of tactics <br>
                to usurp control of the Hindu princely states that were under what were called subsidiary alliances <br>
                with the British. Everywhere the old Indian aristocracy was being replaced by British officials. <br>
                One notable British technique was called the doctrine of lapse, first perpetrated by <br>
                Lord Dalhousie in the late 1840s. It involved the British prohibiting a Hindu ruler without a natural <br>
                heir from adopting a successor and, after the ruler died or abdicated, annexing his land. To those <br>
                problems may be added the growing discontent of the Brahmans, many of whom had been <br>
                dispossessed of their revenues or had lost lucrative positions.<br><br>

                Another serious concern was the increasing pace of Westernization, by which Hindu society was being <br>
                affected by the introduction of Western ideas. Missionaries were challenging the religious beliefs of <br>
                the Hindus. The humanitarian movement led to reforms that went deeper than the political superstructure. <br>
                During his tenure as governor-general of India (1848-56), Lord Dalhousie made efforts toward emancipating <br>
                women and had introduced a bill to remove all legal obstacles to the remarriage of Hindu widows. <br>
                Converts to Christianity were to share with their Hindu relatives in the property of the family estate. <br>
                There was a widespread belief that the British aimed at breaking down the caste system. <br>
                The introduction of Western methods of education was a direct challenge to orthodoxy, both Hindu and Muslim.<br><br><br>
