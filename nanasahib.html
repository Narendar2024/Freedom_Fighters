            <font size="5">
                Balajirao Bhat, commonly known as Nana Sahib, was born in Bithoor (Kanpur District), Uttar <br>
                Pradesh in May 1824. He was the eighth Peshwa of India's Maratha Empire. Balaji Bajirao was <br>
                another name for him. When Chattrapati Shahu died in 1749, he left the Maratha Empire to the <br>
                Peshwas. He did not have an heir to his realm, therefore he nominated the valiant Peshwas as <br>
                his heir. Nana Sahib, as king of the Maratha Empire, made significant contributions to the <br>
                development of Pune. During his rule, Poona was transformed from a small village to a <br>
                metropolis. He redesigned the city by constructing new districts, temples, and bridges. Having <br>
                said that, Sahib was a key contributor to the 1857 revolt, leading a group of enthusiastic rebels. <br>
                He overran the British soldiers in Kanpur and endangered the British camp by murdering the <br>
                survivors. However, after defeating Nana Saheb and his men, the British were able to retake <br>
                Kanpur. <br><br>

                Who was Nana SahebNana Saheb Peshwa II, also known as Dhondu Pant, was an Indian Peshwa of the Maratha empire, <br>
                nobleman, and combatant who led the Kanpur (Cawnpore) uprising during the Great Revolt of 1857. <br>
                Nana Saheb thought he was entitled to a pension from the East India Company as the adopted son of the exiled <br>
                Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao II, but the underlying contractual issues are complex. He joined the rebellion as a <br>
                result of the Company's failure to continue his father's pension after his death, as well as what he <br>
                saw as oppressive regulations. He forced the British military at Kanpur to surrender, then slaughtered the survivors, <br>
                capturing Kanpur for a few days.<br><br>

                The East India Company had banished Peshwa Baji Rao II to Bithoor (near Kanpur) after the Maratha defeat in the <br>
                Third Maratha War, where he maintained a huge establishment supported in part by a British pension. <br><br>

                The British, however, denied Nana's standing as a “Peshwa,” and therefore the annuity was cancelled. <br>
                As a result, Nana rose up against the British and began assembling a band of soldiers. During the 1857 uprising in <br>
                Cawnpore (Kanpur), he led the “sepoys” (British-employed Indian soldiers) <br>
                and successfully forced the British entrenchment to surrender.<br><br>
                Nana eventually took control of the city. A later massacre at the Satichaura Ghat, however, flipped the tables.<br> 
                Nana's forces were attacked by the British. Nana, along with his family, fled to Nepal after his army was defeated. <br><br><br>
