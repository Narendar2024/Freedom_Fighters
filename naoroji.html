                Born on 4th September 1825, was a Mathematics and Natural Philosophy professor. He was <br>
                educated at the Elphinstone College in Bombay. He turned towards politics later in life and<br>
                became very active in the field. His opinion was unfavourable and he felt that the British rule <br>
                would leave and cause irreparable damage to the Indian economy. In the years 1886, 1893 and <br>
                1906, Dadabhai Naoroji had the privilege of presiding over the annual sessions of the Indian <br>
                National Congress. This later led to the nationalist movement in India. His popular writings <br>
                include the article named Poverty and Un-British Rule in India (1901). In this article, he was of <br>
                the strong belief and opinion that India was taxed at a very high rate and all of India's wealth <br>
                was being drained to England.<br><br>
                
                Born in Mumbai in 1825 in a Gujarati-speaking Parsi family, Naoroji was educated at Elphinstone Institute School <br>
                before pursuing a career as an intellectual and campaigner for Indian causes. At a time when the East <br>
                India Company was ruling British India, Naoroji was laying the foundation of India's <br>
                contemporary freedom struggle, establishing India's first political association, <br>
                the Bombay Association, in 1852. In 1855 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics and <br>
                Natural Philosophy at Elphinstone College in Mumbai. The first Indian to be given an academic appointment, <br>
                he was called 'The Promise of India' by another professor at the institution. <br>
                Shortly after he travelled to London to join the first Indian business firm of the mercantile Cama family, <br>
                opening a Liverpool location for Cama & Co, the first Indian company to be established in Britain. However, <br>
                within three years he had resigned on ethical grounds and by 1859 had established his own cotton <br>
                trading company, Dadabhai Naoroji & Co. Alongside this he was also made Professor of <br>
                Gujarati at University College London (1856-65).<br><br>

                In 1867 he went on to help establish the East India Association which aimed to combat prevailing views <br>
                of the Asians as inferior and put the Indian point of view before the British public. <br>
                The organisation eventually merged with the Indian National Association in 1885, <br>
                becoming the Indian National Congress - the main nationalist party that campaigned for <br>
                Indian independence from British rule, later the party of Gandhi and still a prominent party in <br>
                Indian politics today. Meanwhile, in 1874, having returned to India, Naoroji had started his public life as <br>
                the Dewan (minister) to the Maharaja of Barado and later was a member of the of the Legislative Council of Mumbai.<br><br><br>
