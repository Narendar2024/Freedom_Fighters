                Famously known as Punjab Kesari, he was one of the extremist members of the Indian National <br>
                Congress. He formed a trio with Bipin Chandra Pal and Bal Gangadhar Tilak to be known as <br>
                Lal-Bal-Pal where they executed several revolutionary activities. He led the Punjab Protest <br>
                against the Jallianwala Incident and Non-Cooperation Movement. He fought against the Simon <br>
                Commission Protest and lost his life because of a lathi charge by the Britishers.<br><br>

                Lala Lajpat Rai, (born 1865, Dhudike, India—died November 17, 1928, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), <br>
                Indian writer and politician, outspoken in his advocacy of a militant anti-British nationalism in <br>
                the Indian National Congress (Congress Party) and as a leader of the Hindu supremacy movement.<br><br>

                After studying law at the Government College in Lahore, Lajpat Rai practiced at Hissar and Lahore, <br>
                where he helped to establish the nationalistic Dayananda Anglo-Vedic School and became a follower of <br>
                Dayananda Sarasvati, the founder of the conservative Hindu society Arya Samaj (“Society of Aryans”). <br>
                After joining the Congress Party and taking part in political agitation in the Punjab, Lajpat Rai was <br>
                deported to Mandalay, Burma (now Myanmar), without trial, in May 1907. In November, however, he was <bt>
                allowed to return when the viceroy, Lord Minto, decided that there was insufficient evidence to hold him for subversion. <br>
                Lajpat Rai's supporters attempted to secure his election to the presidency of the party session at Surat in <br>
                December 1907, but elements favouring cooperation with the British refused to accept him, and the party split over the issues.<br><br>

                During World War I, Lajpat Rai lived in the United States, where he founded the Indian Home Rule League of America (1917) <br>
                in New York City. He returned to India in early 1920, and later that year he led a special session of the Congress <br>
                Party that launched Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi's noncooperation movement. Imprisoned from 1921 to 1923, <br>
                he was elected to the legislative assembly on his release. In 1928 he introduced the legislative assembly <br>
                resolution for the boycott of the British Simon Commission on constitutional reform. Shortly thereafter he died, <br>
                after being attacked by police during a demonstration in Lahore.<br><br><br>
