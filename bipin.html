                Bipin Chandra Pal was a revolutionary born in 1858 during the Biggest revolution against the <br>
                British Army. He was a significant part of the Indian National Congress and encouraged the <br>
                abandonment of foreign goods. He formed a trio with Lala Lajpat Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak <br>
                to be known as Lal-Bal-Pal where they executed several revolutionary activities.  <br><br>

                Bipin Chandra Pal, (born November 7, 1858, Sylhet, India [now in Bangladesh]—died May 20, 1932, <br>
                Calcutta [now Kolkata]), Indian journalist and an early leader of the nationalist movement. <br>
                By his contributions to various newspapers and through speaking tours, he popularized the concepts <br>
                of swadeshi (exclusive use of Indian-made goods) and swaraj (independence).<br><br>

                Though originally considered a moderate within the Indian National Congress, by 1919 Pal had <br>
                moved closer to the more militant policies of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, one of the leading nationalist politicians. <br>
                In later years Pal allied himself with fellow Bengali nationalists who resented the cult of personality <br>
                surrounding Mahatma Gandhi, the most popular nationalist leader. Pal's overriding concern in his writings <br>
                from 1912 to 1920 was to achieve confederation of the different regions and different communities within India. <br>
                After 1920 he remained aloof from national politics but continued to contribute to Bengali journals.<br><br>

                journalism, the collection, preparation, and distribution of news and related commentary and feature materials <br>
                through such print and electronic media as newspapers, magazines, books, blogs, webcasts, podcasts, social networking <br>
                and social media sites, and e-mail as well as through radio, motion pictures, and television. The word journalism was <br>
                originally applied to the reportage of current events in printed form, specifically newspapers, but with the <br>
                advent of radio, television, and the Internet in the 20th century the use of the term broadened to include all printed <br>
                and electronic communication dealing with current affairs.<br><br>

                The earliest known journalistic product was a news sheet circulated in ancient Rome: the Acta Diurna, said to date <br>
                from before 59 BCE. The Acta Diurna recorded important daily events such as public speeches. It was published daily <br>
                and hung in prominent places. In China during the Tang dynasty, a court circular called a bao, or “report,” was <br>
                issued to government officials. This gazette appeared in various forms and under various names more or less continually <br>
                to the end of the Qing dynasty in 1911. The first regularly published newspapers appeared in German cities <br>
                and in Antwerp about 1609. The first English newspaper, the Weekly Newes, was published in 1622. One of the <br>
                first daily newspapers, The Daily Courant, appeared in 1702.<br><br><br>
