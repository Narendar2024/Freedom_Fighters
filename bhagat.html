                Born in 1907, Bhagat Singh was among the extreme revolutionary Indian freedom fighters. He <br>
                was a largely controversial, though respected figure in the freedom struggle of India. This <br>
                revolutionary hero was born in a Sikh family in the undivided state of Punjab and carried the <br>
                legacy of his family and clinched to his patriotism till his death. He was involved in a plot in 1928 <br>
                to assassinate James Scott, a British police superintendent to exact revenge for the death of <br>
                Lala Lajpat Rai. The plot failed when they mistakenly killed another young police officer and <br>
                Singh fled to Lahore to escape from punishment. The following year, he, along with his <br>
                associates hurled a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi in protest against the <br>
                implementation of the Defence of India Act and surrendered to the police. This great Indian <br>
                freedom fighter was sentenced to death by hanging by the British, and executed at the age of <br>
                only 23. <br><br>

                Bhagat Singh, (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab, India [now in Pakistan]—died <br>
                March 23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement.<br><br>

                Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj <br>
                (a reform sect of modern Hinduism), and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest <br>
                British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also worked <br>
                as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist theories. <br>
                He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the revolution”).<br><br>

                In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of Indian writer <br>
                and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a silent march opposing the <br>
                Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was killed, <br>
                and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929 he and an associate lobbed a bomb at <br>
                the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of India Act and then surrendered. <br>
                He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders.<br><br>

                India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. Its capital is New Delhi, built in the 20th century just <br>
                south of the historic hub of Old Delhi to serve as India's administrative centre. Its government is a constitutional <br>
                republic that represents a highly diverse population consisting of thousands of ethnic groups and likely hundreds of languages. <br>
                With roughly one-sixth of the world's total population, India is the second most populous country, after China.<br><br><br>
