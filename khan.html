                Born on 22nd October 1900, in the district of Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Ashfaqulla Khan <br>
                grew up with the non-cooperation movement going on at the forefront, led by Mahatma Gandhi. <br>
                Just when he was a young gentleman, Ashfaqulla Khan became acquainted with Ram Prasad <br>
                Bismil. He was one of the main conspirators in the Chauri Chaura incident, which took place in <br>
                Gorakhpur. He was a strong advocate of independence and wanted the British to leave India at <br>
                any cost. Ashfaqulla Khan was a popular freedom fighter, known for his true friendship with <br>
                Bismil, was sentenced to death for the Kakori train robbery. It was popularly known as the <br>
                Kakori Conspiracy of 1925.<br><br>

                Ashfaqulla Khan (22nd October, 1900 - 19th December, 1927)<br>
                Ashfaqulla Khan was born in Shahjahanpur, North-Western Province, British India in a Muslims Pathan family of Khyber tribe.<br>
                In 1924, Ashfaqulla Khan formed an organization with like-minded freedom fighters which was named Hindustan Republican Association. <br>
                This association's purpose was to organize armed revolutions to achieve a free India.<br><br>

                To give a boost to their movement and buy arms and ammunition to carry out their activities, the revolutionaries of HSRA, <br>
                including Ram Prasad Bismil, looted the train carrying British government money in Kakori near Lucknow on 9 August, 1925. <br>
                Bismil was caught by the police and Ashfaqulla Khan was the only one untraced by the police. He went into <br>
                hiding and moved to Banaras from Bihar, where he worked in an engineering company for 10 months.<br><br>

                Later, he went to Delhi to find out ways to move out of the country. He took the help of one of his Pathan friends <br>
                who also was his classmate in the past. This friend, in turn, betrayed him by informing the police about his where about sand on <br>
                the morning of 17 July, 1926, police came to his house and arrested him.<br><br>

                The case for the Kakori dacoity was concluded by awarding death sentence to Bismil, Ashfaqulla Khan and few others. <br>
                Ashfaqulla Khan was put to death by hanging on 19 December, 1927, at Faizabad jail. This revolutionary man became a martyr and a <br>
                legend among his people due to his love for the motherland, his clear thinking, unshakeable courage, firmness and loyalty.<br><br><br>
