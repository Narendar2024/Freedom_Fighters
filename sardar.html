            <font size="5">
                Vallabhbhai Patel was born on 31st October 1875. A senior leader of the Indian National <br>
                Congress, he had an immense contribution to the Indian freedom struggle as one of the most <br>
                influential and strong-minded Indian freedom fighters. He was one of the most influential leaders <br>
                of Gujarat, who organized peasant movements against the British based on Gandhi's ideals of <br>
                non-violence. One of the first congress leaders to have accepted the British plan of partition for <br>
                India, he is remembered for his role in integrating the princely states into the dominion of India. <br>
                His efforts led to the integration of around 562 princely states. After independence, he served as <br>
                the first home minister and deputy prime minister of India.<br><br>
                
                Patel was born into a self-sufficient landowning family of the Leva Patidar caste. <br>
                Reared in an atmosphere of traditional Hinduism, he attended primary school at Karamasad and high <br>
                school at Petlad but was mainly self-taught. Patel married at the age of 16, matriculated at 22, <br>
                and passed the district pleader's examination, which enabled him to practice law. In 1900 he set up an <br>
                independent office of district pleader in Godhra, and two years later he moved to Borsad.<br><br>

                As a lawyer, Patel distinguished himself in presenting an unassailable case in a precise <br>
                manner and in challenging police witnesses and British judges. In 1908 Patel lost his wife, who had <br>
                borne him a son and daughter, and thereafter remained a widower. Determined to enhance his career in <br>
                the legal profession, Patel traveled to London in August 1910 to study at the Middle Temple. <br>
                There he studied diligently and passed the final examinations with high honours.<br><br>

                Returning to India in February 1913, he settled in Ahmadabad, rising rapidly to become the leading <br>
                barrister in criminal law at the Ahmadabad bar. Reserved and courteous, he was noted for his <br>
                superior mannerisms, his smart, English-style clothes, and his championship in bridge at Ahmadabad's <br>
                fashionable Gujarat Club. He was, until 1917, indifferent to Indian political activities.<br><br><br>
